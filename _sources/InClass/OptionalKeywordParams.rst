Session 12 In Class Code Samples: PS 5 Q 8
------------------------------------------

.. activecode:: session12_free
    
    # This is provided for your convenience. You can write any code here.

.. activecode:: session12_ps5_8_0

  def is_prefix(s1, s2):
      return s1 == s2[0:len(s1)] 

  print(is_prefix("he", "hello"))

.. activecode:: session12_ps5_8_1

  def is_prefix(s1,s2):
      if s2.find(s1) == 0: #searches for s1 in s2, where s1 starts at index 0
          return True
      else:
          return False

  print(is_prefix("hel","hello"))

.. activecode:: session12_ps5_8_2

  def is_prefix(s1, s2):
      return s1 == s2[0:len(s1)] 
    
  print(is_prefix("he", "hello"))


.. activecode:: session12_ps5_8_ex

  def is_prefix(s1,s2):
      return s2.find(s1) == 0

  #x = 5
  x = -2

  # To illustrate what we're doing with the boolean statement
  if x > 0:
      print(True)
  else:
      print(False)
    
  #That code does exactly the same thing as the following line of code    
  print(x > 0)


.. activecode:: session12_ps5_8_3

  def is_prefix(s1, s2):# not quite right; why not?
      return s1 in s2  
 
  print(is_prefix("ell", "hello"))
  # will get True if the function just uses the in operator, and that's not a prefix

  # Rephrase this problem in English
  # and then translate to code (look stuff up!) 

.. activecode:: session12_ps5_8_4

  # Example using the flag pattern you learned last week
  # Can be used in any kind of iteration, not just indefinite iteration

  def is_prefix(s1, s2):
      is_it_good = True  # This is called a Boolean "flag"
      for i in range(len(s1)):  # [0, 1]
          if s1[i] != s2[i]:
              is_it_good = False
      return is_it_good
     
  print(is_prefix("hel", "hello"))


Review: Rephrasing problems in English
--------------------------------------

.. activecode:: session12_free_grep

    # Space provided for demonstration -- you can write any code here yourself.


Optional/Keyword Parameters Examples
------------------------------------

.. activecode:: session12_01

  # what should the parameter list for f be?
  def f(): # Fill in the parameter list
      print(z, x, y)
        
  f(1)  # should print 30 1 20    
  f(2, 3) # should print 30 2 3    
  f(3, 4, 5) # should print 5 3 4

  # Next,

  f(2, 6) # what will it print? prints 30 2 6
  f(2, z=6) # what will it print?
  f(2, x=6) # what will it print?

  # Also consider: what does the function f return?


Here's a function count_vowels that takes a string and counts how many vowels are in it.

.. activecode:: session12_02

  # here is a function count_vowels
  def count_vowels(s):
      vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'] 
      ct=0 
      for ch in s:
          if ch in vowels:
              ct = ct + 1
      return ct

  # Example invocation and print statement
  print(count_vowels("supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"))


Now using that as a basis, you should generalise the count_vowels function, to count the occurrences of any subset of letters, not just vowels, but treat vowels as the default if not otherwise specified. Fill in the parameter list and the code.

.. activecode:: session12_03

  # fill in the parameter list and function body

  def count_lets():
      # fill this in


  # example invocations with print statements
  print(count_lets("Once upon a midnight dreary", ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']))
  print(count_lets("Once upon a midnight dreary", ['l', 'm', 'm', 'o']))
